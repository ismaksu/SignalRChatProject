<h3> ASP.NET Core and SignalR realtime chat project. </h3>

Hello, welcome to my project's repository.
I did this project to learn SignalR and learn its basics.
This is not a proffessional project, i only did it for learning fundamentals in SignalR.
But I'm trying to improvise this project as much as i can.
